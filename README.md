# bezieR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of bezieR is to It helps visually analyze Bezier curves and
animate their construct function of *f*(*t*). It was inspired by
[Wikipedia
visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#/media/File:B%C3%A9zier_2_big.gif)

`bezieR` is an R package designed for Bezier curves analysis.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Hussain-Alsalman/bezieR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows visualize the relationship between
the control points *P*<sub>*n*</sub>of Bezier curve a common problem:

``` r
library("bezieR")
## basic example code
analyze_bezier(cp_x =c(10,20,30), cp_y = c(10,50,10))
```

You can get an intuition about the control points and Bezier curves
relationship by animating the path of the curve

``` r
animate_bezier(cp_x =c(10,20,30), cp_y = c(10,50,10))
```

# Additional Information

You can read my detailed [blog
post](https://www.arabiananalyst.com/2020/06/28/2020-06-28-bezier-curves/)
about Bezier Curves. It goes a little bit beneath the surface and
discusses some mathematical intuitions behind these curves
